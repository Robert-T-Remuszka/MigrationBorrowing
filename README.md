# Getting Started
You will need to create a few folders in the project directory to ensure that directory stucture matches the relative file paths in the code. Here is a list of "to do's" before running the code.
1. Create a data folder in your cloned repo
2. Create a file called `"credentials.py"` and place it in the code folder. This is where you will keep things like your apikey. In that file write
```python
apikeys = {'ipumskey':'YOUR IPUMS API KEY'}
```
and swap out the `'YOUR IPUMS API KEY'` with, well, your Ipums api key!
